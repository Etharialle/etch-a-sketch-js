# etch-a-sketch-js
Etch-a-Sketch project from the Odin Project

## Tasks
- Create a 16x16 grid of square divs
    - Use JS to create the divs
    - Use a container div to hold the grid
    - Use flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid
- Setup a `hover` effect so the grid divs change color when moused over and
leave a trail like a pen would
- Add a button that will open an a popup window asking for the number of squares
per side for a new grid
    - When a new grid is specified the existing grid is removed
    - A new grid is generated in the same total space as before
    - limit grid size to 100x100
- Make the color a random color
- Make the color darker (opacity)
